# Wedding Planner Application

## Overview

This is a full-stack wedding planning application built with React and Express. The application helps couples organize their wedding by managing guests, budget, vendors, timeline, tasks, and seating arrangements. It features a modern, elegant design with a wedding-themed color palette including rose gold, soft blush, and champagne gold.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript
- **Routing**: Wouter (lightweight client-side routing)
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom wedding theme colors
- **UI Components**: Radix UI components via shadcn/ui component library
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized production builds

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Database Provider**: Neon Database (serverless PostgreSQL)
- **API**: RESTful API endpoints

### Monorepo Structure
- **`client/`**: Frontend React application
- **`server/`**: Backend Express server
- **`shared/`**: Shared TypeScript types and database schema
- **`migrations/`**: Database migration files (generated by Drizzle)

## Key Components

### Database Schema
The application uses a comprehensive schema with the following main entities:
- **Guests**: Name, email, phone, RSVP status, dietary restrictions, table assignments
- **Budget Items**: Category, description, budget vs actual amounts, payment status
- **Timeline Events**: Title, description, start/end times, location, event type
- **Tasks**: Title, description, completion status, due date, priority, category
- **Vendors**: Name, category, contact information, booking status, contract amount
- **Seating Tables**: Table configuration for wedding reception
- **Wedding Details**: Core wedding information and settings

### Frontend Pages
- **Dashboard**: Overview with statistics and quick actions
- **Guests**: Guest management with RSVP tracking
- **Timeline**: Wedding day schedule and event planning
- **Budget**: Financial tracking and expense management
- **Vendors**: Vendor contact and booking management
- **Seating**: Interactive seating chart and table assignments

### UI Components
- Form components for each entity (guests, budget, timeline, tasks, vendors)
- Reusable UI elements from shadcn/ui (buttons, cards, dialogs, forms)
- Interactive seating chart with drag-and-drop functionality
- Custom wedding-themed styling with CSS variables

## Data Flow

1. **Client Requests**: React components use TanStack Query hooks to fetch data
2. **API Layer**: Express routes handle HTTP requests and validate data using Zod schemas
3. **Database Operations**: Drizzle ORM manages database interactions with type safety
4. **Response Handling**: JSON responses are cached by React Query for optimal performance

## External Dependencies

### Core Dependencies
- **Database**: `@neondatabase/serverless` for PostgreSQL connection
- **ORM**: `drizzle-orm` with `drizzle-zod` for schema validation
- **State Management**: `@tanstack/react-query` for server state
- **Forms**: `react-hook-form` with `@hookform/resolvers` for form validation
- **UI Library**: Multiple `@radix-ui/react-*` components
- **Styling**: `tailwindcss` with `class-variance-authority` for component variants
- **Routing**: `wouter` for client-side routing

### Development Dependencies
- **Build Tools**: `vite` for frontend bundling, `esbuild` for backend bundling
- **TypeScript**: Full TypeScript support across the stack
- **Development**: `tsx` for TypeScript execution during development

## Deployment Strategy

### Build Process
1. **Frontend**: Vite builds the React app to `dist/public/`
2. **Backend**: ESBuild bundles the Express server to `dist/index.js`
3. **Database**: Drizzle migrations are applied via `drizzle-kit push`

### Production Setup
- Environment variable `DATABASE_URL` required for database connection
- Server serves static files from `dist/public/` for production
- Development mode uses Vite's development server with HMR

### Scripts
- `npm run dev`: Development server with hot reload
- `npm run build`: Production build for both frontend and backend
- `npm start`: Start production server
- `npm run db:push`: Apply database schema changes
